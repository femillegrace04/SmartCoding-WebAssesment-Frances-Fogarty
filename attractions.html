            <h2>Vasa Museum</h2>
            <p>
              The Vasa Museum is one of Scandinavia's most visited museums. It
              is here that you will find in all its glory, the unique and well
              preserved warship Vasa from 1628, embellished with hundreds of
              wooden sculptures. Around 1.5 million visitors every year enjoy
              the exhibitions in the museum, which describe the warship Vasa's
              history and life at the time; how, after 333 years at the bottom
              of Stockholm bay, the ship was rediscovered and salvaged; and the
              research which is now underway to preserve Vasa. The Vasa Museum
              lies in the royal parkland, Djurgården, in Stockholm.
